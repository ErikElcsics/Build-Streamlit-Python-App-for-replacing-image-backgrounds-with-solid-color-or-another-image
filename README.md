# Build-Streamlit-Python-App-for-replacing-image-backgrounds-with-solid-color-or-another-image
This Streamlit application enables users to remove the background from images and replace it with a solid color or another image.​

Features

- Background Removal: The rembg library is used to remove the background from the uploaded image.​

- Background Replacement:

	- Solid Color Replacement: If the user selects the option to replace the background with a solid color, a color picker is displayed. The chosen color is then used to create a new background, which is composited with the foreground (subject) of the image.​
	- Image Replacement: If the user opts to replace the background with another image, they can upload a background image. This image is resized to match the dimensions of the original image and composited with the foreground.​
	- Image Preview: Displays the original and processed images within the app.​
	- Download Option: After processing, the user can download the image with the new background.
